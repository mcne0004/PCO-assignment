                    What I did before HBO-ICT<br><br>
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Before I began studying HBO-ICT at HZ, I studied 'Allround coworker IT 
                    systems and devices' at Scalda (an MBO school).<br><br>
                    We did a lot of device-oriented stuff, like working with servers and fixing 
                    computer problems. However, we did NOT do much with coding except very basic 
                    stuff. During my internship at Woongoed Middelburg in that school period, 
                    I experimented a lot with Powershell, even made a few very functional programs 
                    there that they were quite happy with.<br><br>
                    From that point on, my interest in programming began developing to a point 
                    where I semi-often messed around with Visual Studio Code and Python.<br><br>
                    During my last internship for Scalda, I was coding a bunch of stuff in Joint 
                    Research Center Zeeland and went faster than they anticipated there. Loek 
                    van der Linde, the data science lab manager there, suggested me to look into 
                    trying out HBO-ICT if I wanted to pursue my interest in programming. This is 
                    what I chose after the HZ Open Day and two walk-in days.
