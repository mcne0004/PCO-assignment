        SWOT analysis
      </h2>
      <p>
        I've made a personal analysis of myself in SWOT formatting, to keep
        my strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats in mind.<br>
        These go as follows:<br><br>
        <strong>Strengths</strong> I have are precise work according to the rules, and working
        together.<br><br>
        <strong>Weaknesses</strong> I have is my hate for repetitive long work and my autism.<br><br>
        <strong>Opportunities</strong> I see are working as a software engineer in a company, perhaps
        even working on the code of games or game engines.<br><br>
        <strong>Threats</strong> I see are my autism causing misunderstandings that could cause problems
        in social settings.
