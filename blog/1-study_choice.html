        Study choice activities
      </h2>
      <p>
        Before actually starting my study at HZ, I participated in several activities
        to be sure of my choice. These are:<br><br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          HZ Open Day; a day where you can look around stalls of multiple different
          programs. You can also get explanations of what they do and what they
          teach.<br><br>
        </li>
        <li>
          Two walk-in days for HBO-ICT; I physically sat down in two lessons and saw
          how the lessons went for me.<br><br>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I was satisfied after doing these activities and felt HBO-ICT was a good fit
        for my interests and skills, so I chose to follow this program.<br><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        After HBO-ICT, I plan to become a software engineer. Maybe, I could even be 
        someone who works on game engines!
