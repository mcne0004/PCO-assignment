                <h2>
                    The role of AI within the IT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Within IT, various forms of AI are used for different fields of IT. In data 
                    science, AI is often used for data prediction and analysis. In surveillance 
                    settings, AI is often used in camera systems to detect people, vehicles and 
                    the flow of both. As of recently, AI is being adopted in coding 
                    environments for problems that people can't easily solve themselves, or 
                    simply as a coding assistant or code reviewing tool. Yes, people even generate 
                    images and videos using AI, although those results tend to look 'off' to most.<br><br>

                <h2>
                    The usage of AI within HBO-ICT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Given AI's quickly growing ability to code quite well, more people at HBO-ICT 
                    use AI for problem-solving. This in itself isn't a problem. However, some of 
                    these students let AI do most of their work without actually understanding 
                    the meaning of the generated code. It's good to keep in mind that AI makes 
                    mistakes, hallucinates quite often and also tends to pick up bad coding habits.<br><br>

                <h2>
                    How I think AI should be used within HBO-ICT
                </h2>
                <p>
                    When using AI, one should keep in mind to use it as a tool, not as a 
                    replacement for your work to prevent potentially unsafe and/or problematic 
                    code from appearing. Also, when using AI in coding, make sure to understand 
                    the code it (re)wrote for you. After all, relying too heavily on what is 
                    essentially a black box of hard-to-predict digital intelligence can turn out 
                    wrong in settings where good code really matters, like a company's website 
                    backend.<br><br>

                <h2>
                    How HBO-ICT could move forwards using AI
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Inherently, AI usage doesn't <i>have</i> to be bad. As long as you know what 
                    your codebase means, what it does and its flaws, then you're good. However, 
                    to prevent AI from becoming a problem within this program, teacher can apply 
                    various methods. These include, but aren't limited to...<br><br>
